# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and the second highest in terms of mortality rates.Diagnosis of breast cancer is performed when an abnormal lump is found (from self-examination or x-ray) or a tiny speck of calcium is seen (on an x-ray). After a suspicious lump is found, the doctor will conduct a diagnosis to determine whether it is cancerous and, if so, whether it has spread to other parts of the body.This breast cancer dataset was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.

**Breast Cancer Prediction Project using Machine Learning Algorithms**
This project is a breast cancer prediction model using Logistic Regression, K Neighbors Classifier, Linear SVM, Kernal SVM,Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and ANN algorithms. The dataset used is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which is a publicly available dataset commonly used for breast cancer prediction. The objective of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

**Algorithms Used**
We will be using eight different machine learning algorithms to build the prediction model: Logistic Regression, K Neighbors Classifier, Linear SVM, Kernal SVM,Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and ANN algorithms. These algorithms have been chosen for their ability to handle classification problems and their performance in similar applications.

**Project Structure**
The project is structured as follows:

breast-cancer-prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for preprocessing the data, building and training the models, and making predictions.
README.md: this file, containing an introduction to the project.
LICENSE: a file containing the license information for the project.

**Conclusion**
The goal of this project is to build a breast cancer prediction model that can accurately classify tumors as benign or malignant. By using multiple machine learning algorithms and fine-tuning their hyperparameters, we hope to achieve high accuracy and create a useful tool for medical professionals.
